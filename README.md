Math functions to use in Ignition

This hub is about math functions that are't implemented in the standar Ignition or jythons' math functions. I'm Thinking it as a root folder called ignition-math where subfolders with specific kind of operations are worked upon.

We can change this if it doesnt end fitting to the code development.
